# Credit Card Landing Page
I created this credit card landing page project using HTML and CSS, which gave me more experience in understanding how HTML and CSS work in designing any web page.

### What I learned from this project
* Through this project, I learned to use HTML elements and tags, and also learned how to position them using CSS.
* In this project, I learned to overlap two images on top of each other and then place two more images on the left and right ends.
* The portion where I learned the most about how to position things was with that image.
